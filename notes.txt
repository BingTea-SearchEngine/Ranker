For the intermediate rankers, they are a binary classifier of "relevant"
or "not relevant". For the data on each query, supply some "not
relevant" data as well (data that wasn't returned by Google). Also
purposefully give it less "not relevant" data, that way the model isn't
punished as much for false positives, but more heavily on false
negatives. For example:

10 relevant
5 nonrelevant

Train:
8 relevant
4 nonrelevant

Test:
2 relevant
1 nonrelevant

Static:
URL length
DOC length
domain
PageRank
CheiRank
DomainRank (maybe)

Dynamic:
Short spans
In order spans
Exact phrases
Average word counts
Average word percent

CURRENTLY, SELF-LOOPS ARE PRESENT IN THE SAVED FROM-TO AND TO-FROM
FILES, BUT THEY ARE OMMITTED IN READ_BITSTREAM! IF YOU DON'T INITIALIZE
WITH READ_BITSTREAM, THEN SELF-LOOPS WILL BE PRESENT
